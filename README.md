# WEB

This code demonstrates my WEB(HTML, CSS, JavaScript) skills.
The [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com/) library was used to scroll through the slides(requires an internet connection).
JavaScript is used to get an index, to set a description for each slide(description is extracted from an array of strings).


Site itself is located at the following [address.](https://quant12345.github.io/index.html)

For gif files to work correctly, use browsers: Chromium or Opera.
